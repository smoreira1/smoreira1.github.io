You can deploy a server-side rendered Astro site to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy), a distributed system that runs JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, worldwide.

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Deno Deploy through Github Actions or Deno Deploy's CLI.

## Requirements

This guide assumes you already have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed.

## Project Configuration

Your Astro project can be deployed to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) as a server-side rendered site (SSR). Deno Deploy does not support static sites.

### Adapter for SSR

To enable SSR in your Astro project and deploy on Deno Deploy:

1. Install [the Deno adapter](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations/deno) to your projectâ€™s dependencies.

    ```bash
      npm install @astrojs/deno
    ```

1. Update your `astro.config.mjs` project configuration file with the changes below.

    ```js ins={3,6-7}
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import deno from '@astrojs/deno';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: deno(),
    });
    ```

1. Update your `preview` script in `package.json` with the change below.

    ```json del={8} ins={9}
    // package.json
    {
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev",
        "start": "astro dev",
        "build": "astro build",
        "preview": "astro preview"
        "preview": "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env ./dist/server/entry.mjs"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    You can now use this command to preview your production Astro site locally with Deno.
    
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Deno Deploy through Github Actions or using Deno Deployâ€™s CLI (command line interface).

### Github Actions Deployment

If your project is stored on GitHub, the [Deno Deploy website](https://dash.deno.com/) will guide you through setting up Github Actions to deploy your Astro site.

1. Push your code to a public or private Github repository.

1. Sign in on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com/) with your Github account, and click on [New Project](https://dash.deno.com).

1. Select your repository, the branch you want to deploy from, and select **Github Action** mode. (Your Astro site requires a build step, and cannot use Automatic mode.)
   
1. In your Astro project, create a new file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and paste in the YAML below. This is similar to the YAML given by Deno Deploy, with the additional steps needed for your Astro site.

    ```yaml
    name: Deploy
    on: [push]

    jobs:
      deploy:
        name: Deploy
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
          id-token: write # Needed for auth with Deno Deploy
          contents: read # Needed to clone the repository

        steps:
          - name: Clone repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          # Not using npm? Change `npm ci` to `yarn install` or `pnpm i`
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm ci
    
          # Not using npm? Change `npm run build` to `yarn build` or `pnpm run build`
          - name: Build Astro
            run: npm run build

          - name: Upload to Deno Deploy
            uses: denoland/deployctl@v1
            with:
              project: my-deno-project # TODO: replace with Deno Deploy project name
              entrypoint: server/entry.mjs
              root: dist
    ```

1. After committing this YAML file, and pushing to Github on your configured deploy branch, the deploy should begin automatically!

   You can track the progress using the "Actions" tab on your Github repository page, or on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com).


### CLI Deployment

1. Install the [Deno Deploy CLI](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/deployctl).

    ```bash
    deno install --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run --no-check -r -f https://deno.land/x/deploy/deployctl.ts
    ```

1. Run your Astro build step.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

1. Run `deployctl` to deploy!

   In the command below, replace `<ACCESS-TOKEN>` with your [Personal Access Token](https://dash.deno.com/user/access-tokens) and `<MY-DENO-PROJECT>` with your Deno Deploy project name.

    ```bash
    DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN=<ACCESS-TOKEN> deployctl deploy --project=<MY-DENO-PROJECT> --no-static --include=./dist ./dist/server/entry.mjs
    ```
    
    You can track all your deploys on [Deno Deploy](https://dash.deno.com).

1. (Optional) To simplify the build and deploy into one command, add a `deploy-deno` script in `package.json`.

    ```json ins={9}
    // package.json
    {
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "astro dev",
        "start": "astro dev",
        "build": "astro build",
        "preview": "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env ./dist/server/entry.mjs"
        "deploy-deno": "npm run build && deployctl deploy --project=<MY-DENO-PROJECT> --no-static --include=./dist ./dist/server/entry.mjs"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Then you can use this command to build and deploy your Astro site in one step.
    
    ```bash
    DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN=<ACCESS-TOKEN> npm run deno-deploy
    ```
