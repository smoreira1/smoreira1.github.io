You can use [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/) to host an Astro site for your [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) projects, groups, or user account.

Check out [the official GitLab Pages Astro example project](https://gitlab.com/pages/astro)!

## How to deploy

1. Set the correct `.site` in `astro.config.mjs`.
2. Set `dist` in `astro.config.mjs` to `public` and `public` in `astro.config.mjs` to a newly named folder that is holding everything currently in `public`. The reasoning is because `public` is a second source folder in astro, so if you would like to output to `public` you'll need to pull public assets from a different folder. Your `astro.config.mjs` might end up looking like this:

   ```js
   export default defineConfig({
     sitemap: true,
     site: 'https://astro.build/',
   });
   ```

3. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content:

   ```yaml
   image: node:14
   pages:
     cache:
       paths:
         - node_modules/
     script:
       - npm install
       - npm run build
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - public
     only:
       - main
   ```
