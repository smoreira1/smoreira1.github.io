Astro provides several different tools to help you troubleshoot and debug your code.

## Common Error Messages

Here are some common error messages you might see in the terminal, what they might mean, and what to do about them.

### Cannot use import statement outside a module

In Astro components, `<script>` tags are hoisted and loaded as [JS modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) by default. If you have included the [`is:inline` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#isinline) or any other attribute in your tag, this default behavior is removed.

**Solution**: If you have added any attributes to your `<script>` tag, you must also add the `type="module"` attribute to be able to use import statements.

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

**Not sure that this is your problem?**  
Check to see if anyone else has reported [this issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Cannot+use+import+statement)!

### Unable to render component

This indicates an error in a component you have imported and are using in your Astro template.

#### Common cause

This can be caused by attempting to access the `window` or `document` object at render time. By default, Astro will render your component [isomorphically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript), meaning it runs on the server where the browser runtime is not available. You can disable this pre-render step using [the `client:only` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly).

**Solution**: Try to access those objects after rendering (ex: [`useEffect()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) in React or [`onMounted()`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onmounted) in Vue and [`onMount()`](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-onmount) in Svelte).

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

#### Not that?

**Solution**: Check the appropriate documentation for your [Astro](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) or [UI framework](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) component. Consider opening an Astro starter template from [astro.new](https://astro.new) and troubleshooting just your component in a minimal Astro project.

### Expected a default export

This error can be thrown when trying to import or render an invalid component, or one that is not working properly. (This particular message occurs because of the way importing a UI component works in Astro.)

**Solution**: Try looking for errors in any component you are importing and rendering, and make sure it's working correctly. Consider opening an Astro starter template from [astro.new](https://astro.new) and troubleshooting just your component in a minimal Astro project.

**Status**: Expected Astro behavior, as intended.

## Common gotchas

### My component is not rendering

First, check to see that you have **imported the component** in your [`.astro` component script](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#the-component-script) or [`.mdx` file](/en/guides/markdown-content/#using-components-in-mdx).

Then check your import statement:

- Is your import linking to the wrong place? (Check your import path.)

- Does your import have the same name as the imported component? (Check your component name and that it [follows the `.astro` syntax](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#differences-between-astro-and-jsx).)

- Have you included the extension in the import? (Check that your imported file contains an extension. e.g. `.astro`, `.md`, `.vue`, `.svelte`. Note: File extensions are **not** required for `.js(x)` and `.ts(x)` files only.)

### My component is not interactive

If your component is rendering (see above) but is not responding to user interaction, then you may be missing a [`client:*` directive](/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) to hydrate your component.

By default, a [UI Framework component is not hydrated in the client](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components). If no `client:*` directive is provided, its HTML is rendered onto the page without JavaScript.

:::tip
[Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are HTML-only templating components with no client-side runtime. But, you can use a `<script>` tag in your Astro component template to send JavaScript to the browser that executes in the global scope.

### Cannot find package 'X'

If you see a `"Cannot find package 'react'"` (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, that means that you need to install that package into your project.  Not all package managers will install peer dependencies for you automatically. If you are on Node v16+ and using npm, you should not need to worry about this section.

React, for example, is a peer dependency of the `@astrojs/react` integration. That means that you should install the official `react` and `react-dom` packages alongside your integration. The integration will then pull from these packages automatically.

```shell ins="react react-dom"
# Example: Install integrations and frameworks together
npm install @astrojs/react react react-dom
```
See [Astro's integration guide](/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for instructions on adding framework renderers, CSS tools and other packages to Astro.

### `Astro.glob()` - no matches found

When using `Astro.glob()` to import files, be sure to use the correct glob syntax that will match all the files you need.

#### Filepaths

For example, use `../components/**/*.js` in `src/pages/index.astro` to import both of the following files:
- `src/components/MyComponent.js`
- `src/components/includes/MyOtherComponent.js`

#### Supported Values

 `Astro.glob()` does not support dynamic variables and string interpolation.

This is not a bug in Astro. It is due to a limitation of [Vite's `import.meta.glob()` function](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import) which only supports static string literals.

A common workaround is to instead import a larger set of files that includes all the files you need using `Astro.glob()`, then filter them:

```astro {6-7}
---
// src/components/featured.astro
const { postSlug } = Astro.props;
const pathToMyFeaturedPost = `src/pages/blog/${postSlug}.md`;

const posts = await Astro.glob('../pages/blog/*.md');
const myFeaturedPost = posts.find(post => post.file.includes(pathToMyFeaturedPost));
---

<p>
  Take a look at my favorite post, <a href={myFeaturedPost.url}>{myFeaturedPost.frontmatter.title}</a>!
</p>
```

### Using Astro with Yarn 2+ (Berry)

Yarn 2+, a.k.a. Berry, uses a technique called [Plug'n'Play (PnP)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) to store and manage Node modules, which can [cause problems](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/3450) while initializing a new Astro project using `create-astro` or while working with Astro. A workaround is to set the [`nodeLinker` property](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#nodeLinker) in `yarnrc.yml` to `node-modules`:

```yaml
nodeLinker: "node-modules"
```

## Tips and tricks

### Debugging with `console.log()`

`console.log()` is a simple-but-popular method of debugging your Astro code. Where you write your `console.log` statment will determine where your debugging output is printed.

#### Frontmatter

A `console.log()` statement in Astro frontmatter will always output to the **terminal** running the Astro CLI. This is because Astro runs on the server, and never in the browser.

```astro {5}
---
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

// Example: Outputs "4" to the CLI terminal
console.log(sum(2, 2));
---
```

#### JS scripts

Code that is written or imported inside of an Astro `<script>` tag is run in the browser. Any `console.log()` statements or other debug output will be  printed to the console in your browser.

### Debugging framework components

[Framework components](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/) (like React and Svelte) are unique: They render server-side by default, meaning that `console.log()` debug output will be visible in the terminal. However, they can also be hydrated for the browser, which may cause your debug logs to also appear in the browser.

This can be useful for debugging differences between the SSR output and the hydrated components in the browser.

### Astro `<Debug />` component

To help you debug your Astro components, Astro provides a built-in [`<Debug />`](/en/reference/api-reference/#debug-) component which renders any value directly into your component HTML template. This is useful for quick debugging in the browser without having to flip back-and-forth between your terminal and your browser.

```astro {2,7}
---
import { Debug } from 'astro/components';
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
---

<!-- Example: Outputs {answer: 6} to the browser -->
<Debug answer={sum(2, 4)} />
```

The Debug component supports a variety of syntax options for even more flexible and concise debugging:

```astro {2,7-9}
---
import { Debug } from 'astro/components';
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const answer = sum(2, 4);
---
<!-- Example: All three examples are equivalent. -->
<Debug answer={sum(2, 4)} />
<Debug {{answer: sum(2, 4)}} />
<Debug {answer} />
```
