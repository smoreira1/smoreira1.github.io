This **[Astro integration][astro-integration]** enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) components.

## Installation

There are two ways to add integrations to your project. Let's try the most convenient option first!

### `astro add` command

Astro includes a CLI tool for adding first party integrations: `astro add`. This command will:

1.  (Optionally) Install all necessary dependencies and peer dependencies
2.  (Also optionally) Update your `astro.config.*` file to apply this integration

To install `@astrojs/solid-js`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

```sh
# Using NPM
npx astro add solid
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add solid
# Using PNPM
pnpx astro add solid
```

If you run into any hiccups, [feel free to log an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues) and try the manual installation steps below.

### Install dependencies manually

First, install the `@astrojs/solid-js` integration like so:

```sh
npm install @astrojs/solid-js
```

Most package managers will install associated peer dependencies as well. Still, if you see a "Cannot find package 'solid-js'" (or similar) warning when you start up Astro, you'll need to install SolidJS:

```sh
npm install solid-js
```

Now, apply this integration to your `astro.config.*` file using the `integrations` property:

**`astro.config.mjs`**

```js
import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';

export default {
  // ...
  integrations: [solid()],
}
```

## Getting started

To use your first SolidJS component in Astro, head to our [UI framework documentation][astro-ui-frameworks]. You'll explore:

*   ðŸ“¦ how framework components are loaded,
*   ðŸ’§ client-side hydration options, and
*   ðŸª† opportunities to mix and nest frameworks together

Also check our [Astro Integration Documentation][astro-integration] for more on integrations.
