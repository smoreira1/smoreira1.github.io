## Intro

> This section is an attempt to include my full tech stack that I am passionate about, use everyday, and attempt to become an expert in said stack everyday. I personnally believe that first you must enjoy the technologies you work with, these listed technologies might not be for you. There are plenty of technology stackes that people love, and others hate. Technology stacks that have driven people out of the software industry. _Find a stack you enjoy first, find a community around it._ This would be my first advise for anyone in our field.

## Hardware

I mainly perfer the Windows OS, though I do have a Mac, several Andriod phones and iOS devices.
These help me get a better sense of the end user, which devices they may be on, how those devices behave, and how
the end user might interact with said device. I do my best to cycle through the devices to always get a good sense of what
the end user may be experience.
